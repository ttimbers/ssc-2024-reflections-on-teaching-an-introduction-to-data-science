# Reflections on scaling an Introduction to Data Science
- Author: Tiffany Timbers & Trevor Campbell, 2024

Five years ago the Statistics Department at University of British Columbia 
launched an introductory Data Science course targeted at first year students. 
This new course started out small (with just 59 students)
and aimed to use evidence-based pedagogical practices 
(e.g., flipped classroom, pair-programming),
open educational resources,
and modern technology platforms 
(R and the tidyverse in Jupyter notebooks, autograding using nbgrader, 
and a JupyterHub integrated with Canvas for authentication). 
Since its instantiation in 2019, the course has scaled dramatically, 
serving over 2300 students at UBC this year,
and is now offered in a choice of programming languages (either R or Python).
Here we reflect upon and discuss what has worked and what hasn't. 
We consider the perspectives from the students and the instructional team.
